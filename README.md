# Artificial-Intelligence-Project-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
The Handwritten Digits Recognition project aims to enable computers to recognize human-written digits, which is challenging due to the variability in handwriting styles. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with the PyTorch library, trained on the MNIST dataset, to accurately identify digits from images.
