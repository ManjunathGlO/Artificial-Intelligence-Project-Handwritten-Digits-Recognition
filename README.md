# Artificial-Intelligence-Project-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
The Handwritten Digits Recognition project aims to enable computers to recognize human-written digits, which is challenging due to the variability in handwriting styles. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with the PyTorch library, trained on the MNIST dataset, to accurately identify digits from images.

Implementation Steps : -
Import the libraries and load the dataset
Preprocess the data
Create the model
Train the model
Evaluate the model
Create GUI to predict digits
