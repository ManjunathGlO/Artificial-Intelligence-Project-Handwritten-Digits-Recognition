# Artificial-Intelligence-Project-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
The Handwritten Digits Recognition project aims to enable computers to recognize human-written digits, which is challenging due to the variability in handwriting styles.
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with the PyTorch library, trained on the MNIST dataset, to accurately identify digits from images.

Implementation Steps : -

1) Import the libraries and load the dataset
2) Preprocess the data
3) Create the model
4) Train the model
5) Evaluate the model
6) Create GUI to predict digits
